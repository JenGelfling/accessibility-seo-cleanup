# Accessibility and SEO Optimization for Horiseon
This is a cleaner version of the code for Horiseon.

For this assignment, I modified the html to include semantic elements and to be more SEO optimized. I modified the css code to be more streamlined, concise, and use fewer classes. 

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
